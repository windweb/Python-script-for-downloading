"""
The construction if __name__ == "__main__": 
is a way to ensure that a Python script is only executed as the main program and not imported as a module into another script.

When a Python script is run, the __name__ special attribute is automatically set to "__main__". 
Therefore, if the script is being executed as the main program, __name__ will be equal to "__main__". 
If the script is being imported as a module into another script, __name__ will be set to the name of the module.

So, in this code, the main() function is only run if the script is executed as the main program, and not imported as a module.
